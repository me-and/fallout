I am taking Bethesda's excellent [Fallout Shelter](http://www.falloutshelter.com/) slightly more seriously than is perhaps sensible.  This repository stores scripts for min-maxing my vault.

It also turns out to be good practice at writing simple recursive algorithms, which it turns out I'm decidedly rusty at.
